# Documentation on Foundation documentation

## Folder stucture

### Top level

The overall folder structure is as follows:

Each Foundation Project has its own folder (like Foundation.Cms). In it there is a folder for *Page Types* and *Block Types*. In each of those there is a *Screenshots* folder for any screenshots used in the documentation.

### "Content" Type folder

For each documentable item there is a separate file (such as *Standard Page.md*). So, one file per page type and per block type!

## Naming Convention

### File names

The file naming is straight-forward. If the documentable Page Type is *Single Column Landing Page*, then its documentation file is called *Single Column Landing Page.md*. If the Block Type is *YouTube Block*, its documentation file is called *YouTube Block.md*.

### Names of screenshots

There are genarally three screen shots per doucumentable item:
- Content Type icon (as seen when the editor adds a new content)
- Content tab (where the content type-specific properties reside)
- OPE view

- Name of the type (*Standard Page*)
- Property list
- Technical information
    * Category
    * Inherits
    * Restrictions
- Preview
